/*
 * Jake, Errors get resolved during run time. They're mostly an unfortunate down side to working with CG and Shader graph in combination.
 * 
 * John, Go nuts and have fun with the shader. It will work on everything p much the same way. Bobby is working on the implementation of his shader into the diffuse/albedo channel for base color.
 * 
 * Chris, Your playground is in the works. Will be done by Sun
 * 
 * Bobby, Convert your shader into a sub graph and attach it to replace the "diffuse color" option in a duplicate of "WitchGameGeneralShader". It should render everything correctly, I'm not sure how the shader will look with the UVs, but it's based on camera position so hopefully everything will come up Milhouse for once.
